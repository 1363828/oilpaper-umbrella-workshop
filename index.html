                                    is a symbol of love. Many love stories have taken place under oilpaper umbrellas
                                    throughout the ages. Each part of the oilpaper umbrella has a beautiful meaning. The
                                    umbrella ribs are made of bamboo which means getting promoted swiftly. The shape of
                                    the umbrella is round, which symbolizes happiness, reunion and safeness. In

                                </div>
                                <p>Traditional oilpaper umbrella making procedure is very complex and also time
                                    consuming for the whole process is completely by hand. However, in our activity, you
                                    can experience almost every part of the procedure in a simpler way. The processes
                                    are as follows:
                                    <br />
                                    1) We first introduce ourselves and I would introduce the history and cultural
                                    meanings of oiled umbrella.
                                    <br />
                                    2) You are supposed to work with 1 or 2 people in a group to stick the cotton paper
                                    to the umbrella frame. You are advised to cooperate to cut the cotton paper to a
                                    particular shape according with the ready-made umbrella frame. And then, you should
                                    make the cotton paper adhere to the frame using the glue provided.
                                    <br />
                                    3) Then you could draw on the blank oilpaper umbrella. As the most interesting part
                                    of this activity, draw whatever you want on the umbrella fabric to beautify your
                                    oilpaper umbrella by using your imagination and creativity.
                                    <br />
                                    4) After painting on the umbrella’s fabric, you need to make the umbrella
                                    water-proof.
                                    To achieve this, you need to brush Tong oil over the umbrella fabric, which is also
                                    considered to be a protection of the paintings.
                                    <br />
                                    5) To let the oil just brushed dry, the umbrellas need to take a few-days
                                    sunbathing, which is the very last step of this D.I.Y activity. After exposure to
                                    sunlight, finally you will get the perfect traditional oiled paper umbrella.
